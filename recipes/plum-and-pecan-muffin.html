    <h4>Plum and Pecan Muffins</h4>
    <p>These plum and pecan muffins are loaded with fruit, so you'll get a taste of plum in every bite. The pecans and ginger bring additional layers of flavor to the sweet, ripe plums.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely</li>
